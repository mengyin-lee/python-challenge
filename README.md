# In this challenge, for both PyBank and PyPoll
# I have used a logic flow that
# First, read through the source data file 
# and pre-calculate or summarize the data for next analysis
# Both temporary working files are created as part of the scripts and are checked in for reference
- PyBank\"budget_w_change.csv"
- PyPoll\"poll_w_votes.csv"
# *Analysis Results are save in folder - 'analysis',including Summary reports and termininal printout
